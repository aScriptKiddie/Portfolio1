## 🖥️ Setup Recommendation

For the smoothest experience, it is recommended that you have 2 browser tabs open side-by-side while customizing the portfolio.

🪟 Windows Users / 🐧 Linux Users

      Then press on your keyboard:
   
          Windows/Super Key + ← (left arrow key)  **Press both at the same time**
      
      This will show instructions to the left side of your screen.


2. Open a second tab for editing the code.
   
      Then press on your keyboard:
   
         Windows/Super Key + → (right arrow key)   **Press both at the same time**
            
      This will show instructions to the right side of your screen.

🍎 macOS Users

1. Open one tab for reading these instructions.

      Hover over the green fullscreen button at the top-left corner of the window.

## 🏠 Home Page Customization

✨ Step 1: Open the Correct File

          src/components/Home/Home.js

✨ Step 2: Customizing the Greeting Wave

Inside `Home.js`, you will see a commented instruction between **line 19** and **line 21**.

It will ask you to choose a skin tone for the waving hand emoji.

Choose **ONLY ONE** of these:

      👋👋🏻👋🏼👋🏽👋🏾👋🏿

Please select **only one emoji**.

If multiple emojis are chosen, the code may not work correctly. Stay on the same file for step 3.


---


✨ Step 3: Changing Your Name

You will see something like this on the Home Page:

Replace it with your real name, your nickname or anything you would like visitors to call you.

✨ Step 6: Customizing Your Portfolio Brand Name

## 📂 Projects Page Customization

✨ Step 1: Customizing Your Projects Text

Now we’re moving onto the **Projects Section** of the portfolio. Don’t worry, we’ve already completed around **80% of the customization** 🎉

This section is where visitors can explore your projects, labs, write-ups, tools, and anything else you want to showcase.

Each individual project card contains text that helps visitors understand:

* The project title
* What the project does
* And why the project matters

Open the Projects.js File. Located here:

      src/components/Projects/Projects.js

Yes, the file is called **Projects.js**. This file controls all of the project cards displayed in the Projects section of your portfolio.


Inside `Projects.js`, you will find instructions on **line 19**:

Each project card contains:

* A title
* A description
* A write-up link
* * An image pathway

To customize your projects, simply change the text inside the:

      title=

and

      description=


Each project card also contains a:

      writeuplink=

This link should redirect visitors to your project write-up. Your project write-ups are located here:

      src/components/Projects/Writeups

Make sure each project card links to the correct write-up file.

To add or replace the image on the project card.
?????????????????????????????????????????????


If you want to add additional projects to your portfolio, you can duplicate an existing project card.

Simply copy all code between:

      <Col md={4} className="project-card">
      </Col>

Then paste it underneath another project card.

After that, just replace the:

* Title
* Description
* Image
* And write-up link

with your new project information.

When copying project cards:

* Make sure you copy the entire block.
* Keep the same formatting and indentation.
* Avoid deleting brackets or symbols accidentally.

Small formatting mistakes can stop the Projects section from rendering correctly.
